\chapter{Introduction}

The future upgrade of the \gls{lhc} accelerator, the \gls{slhc}, will increase the beam luminosity leading to a corresponding growth of the amount of data to be treated by the data acquisition systems. This will thus require high rate data links and high radiation tolerant \glslink{asic}{ASICs}.\\
To address these needs, the GBT architecture and transmission protocol was developed to provide the simultaneous transfer of readout data, timing and trigger signals in addition to slow control and monitoring data. \\
The GBT system can be described in two parts, where one half of the system consists of radiation hard GBT ASICs that will act as detectors and will thus be located in the radioactive zone. These ASICs will be used to implement bidirectional multipurpose $4.8\ \giga\bit\per\second$ optical links for the high-energy physics experiments. The other half of the system consists of commercial off-the-shelf components that will through the optical link of the GBT system
