\chapter{SignalTap II: Receiving end of the fiber-optic external loopback test}

Results from the test of the dedicated SFP-connector on the HDMI-daughter card for fiber-optic communication. The purpose was to see if it was possible for the connector to send and receive information at speeds corresponding the \gls{gbt}-standard of $4.8 \giga\bit\per\second$. The result was positive that the receiver was able to receive the transmitted incremental counter, and figure \ref{fig:lb_rx} shows parts of the counter received at the receiving end (see \ref{sec:exlooptest} for more information).
